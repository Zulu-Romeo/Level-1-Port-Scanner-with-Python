# Level-1-Port-Scanner-with-Python

Hey There !

Following is Python code i wrote for scanning ports Open on your Router IP.

The syntax for giving argumets is following:

->python3 filename.py <ip>

Its just a beginner level Port Scanner which could be improved in many ways.

I tried to do proper commenting so that it would be easy to understand the Code flow.

There are some drawback and their alternatives which i have provided in the code file.

Thanks.
Have a Good Day
